#🧠 Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning
#In this project, I created a machine learning model to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset. I followed #12 simple steps including data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and saving the final model.The model I built using Support Vector Machine (SVM) gave a #high accuracy of 97% on the test data.

#🗂️ Project Pipeline – 12 Simple & Powerful Steps

1️. Importing Required Libraries
I started by importing all the essential libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn to perform data manipulation, visualization, model training, and evaluation. This sets up the environment.

2️. Load the Dataset
I used the Breast Cancer dataset available from sklearn.datasets, which contains 30 numeric features derived from digitized images of breast masses. These features describe the characteristics of cell nuclei.

3️. Convert to DataFrame for Easier Visualization
To better handle the dataset, I converted it into a pandas DataFrame. This made it easier to view the structure, manipulate data, and create visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

4️. EDA Process: Visualizing Class and Feature Distributions
I explored the dataset using visualizations like count plots and histograms to understand class distribution (benign vs malignant) and the spread of features. This helped identify potential patterns and anomalies.

5️. Data Preprocessing: Scaling Features
Since machine learning models like SVM are sensitive to feature scales, I applied StandardScaler to normalize the data. This ensured that all features contributed equally to the model’s learning.

6️. Overview of the Dataset
Using .info(), .head(), and .shape, I reviewed the structure of the dataset, checked for null values, and observed the dimensions to ensure data quality and consistency.

7️. Visualizing Feature Relationships using PairGrid
I used Seaborn’s PairGrid to visualize how selected features like mean radius, worst texture, and worst area interact with one another. These multi-plot grids gave me deeper insight into feature behavior.

8️. Correlation Heatmap of Features
To identify strong or weak relationships among features, I created a correlation heatmap. This helped in feature selection and understanding multicollinearity.

9️. Installing Dependencies
Some external dependencies (like matplotlib-venn for future work) were installed to support extended visualizations, especially when working in Colab or virtual environments.

10. Data Balancing and Feature Normalization
Since the dataset was slightly imbalanced, I used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the classes. After balancing, I applied feature scaling again to maintain uniformity across data.

11. Support Vector Machine (SVM) Tuning and Evaluation
I tuned different SVM kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF) using GridSearchCV to find the best parameters. I then evaluated each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

12. Model Training and Serialization
Once I identified the best-performing model, I trained it fully and saved it using pickle. The final model was exported as .sav and .pkl files for easy reuse in web apps or other projects.

#📦 Requirements :
